        Art to me is an idea, an expression, and most importantly a lifestyle.
        Visual arts use their surface appearance to evoke deeper inspirations,
        which can vary based on who the viewer is. Art takes various forms and
        is not limited to just painting, photography or music even though they
        might be the most direct to express artistic feelings.

        My life circles around Art and without it, my personal hobbies would have
        never developed:  I like the speed and beautiful moves in fencing, mysterious
        sleight of hand in modern magic, profound and perfectly presented plot in
        movies, and intense motions in cardistry. Sometimes, what really catches me
        is just a feeling, a feeling of art which is usually profound, mysterious,
        and hard to be explained with human language. This feeling often comes
        from life but goes beyond reality. It encourages me to use different kinds
        of medias to present what I see as an artist myself, through which I hope
        will inspire others.

        Drawing, painting and photography are the three parts I would love to
        share with on this website. Also, Iâ€™d like to share some of my magic
        teaching videos. If any questions, you are very welcome to email 
        me (ytian2021@gmail.com).
