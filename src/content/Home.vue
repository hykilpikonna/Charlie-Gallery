        Art to me is an idea, an expression, and most importantly a lifestyle. Visual
        art uses its surface appearance to evoke deeper inspirations, which can vary
        based on who the viewer is.
        </p>
        <p>
        Art takes various forms and is not limited to just painting, photography or music,
        even though they might be the most direct to express artistic feelings. As an
        artist myself, my life circles around Art, and without it my personal hobbies would
        have never developed: I like the speed and beautiful moves in fencing, mysterious
        sleight of hand in modern magic, profound and inspiring plots in movies, and intense
        motions in cardistry. Sometimes, what really catches me is just a feeling, a feeling
        of art which is usually profound, mysterious, and hard to be explained with human
        language. This feeling often comes from life but goes beyond reality. It encourages
        me to use different kinds of medias to present what I see as an artist myself, through
        which I hope will inspire others.

        I have been volunteering for many events to serve communities through my ability as an artist,
        and have participated in teaching arts on multiple service trips and designing things for school
        and communities in town. For me, art is not only a pursue of beyond-life state, but also a
        life style through which I embrace the world.

        This website is created as another of my attempt to serve communities, through which I will
        sell high-quality reproductions of my artworks and use the money for donation purpose.

        If you like my artwork and wish to purchase photos or high-quality drawing reproductions,
        you are very welcome to contact me by e-mail at ytian2021@gmail.com.
